## Aaron — March 30, 2026 (torn paper rewrite + testimonial quote)

**What changed (Torn paper system rewrite):**

**Torn paper architecture overhaul:**
- Removed all standalone `<TornPaperDivider>` components from between sections (old approach)
- New approach: absolutely positioned `<img>` SVGs inside sections, positioned so the flat/solid edge sits flush at the section boundary and the torn edge extends into the adjacent section
- Removed `TornPaperDivider` import from `app/page.tsx`

**Homepage torn paper placements (app/page.tsx):**
- Hero → Growth: `paper-white-1.svg` at top of growth section, rendered white via CSS filter `brightness(0) invert(1)`, `translateY(-55%)`
- Growth → Ecosystem: `paper-grey-bottom-2.svg` at bottom of growth section, `translateY(55%)`
- Ecosystem top: `paper-white-top-1.svg` (swapped from black — white blends with ecosystem bg), `translateY(-55%)`
- Ecosystem → How It Works: `paper-black-top-2.svg` at bottom of ecosystem, flat edge flush + 2px nudge to close gap
- How It Works → Testimonials: `paper-black-bottom-2.svg` at bottom, `translateY(calc(100% - 2px))` — flat edge flush, torn edge extends into white testimonials
- Ecosystem section overflow changed from `overflow-clip` to `overflow-visible`
- How It Works section overflow changed from `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-visible`

**FooterBanner (components/sections/FooterBanner.tsx):**
- Top: `paper-red-top-2.svg` (created from paper-black-top-2 with red fill #F92524), `translateY(calc(-100% + 2px))` — torn edge extends into white testimonials
- Bottom: `paper-red-bottom-1.svg` at bottom, `translateY(55%)` — overlapping into footer
- Changed `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-visible` to allow torn paper bleed

**New SVG files created:**
- `public/images/paper-red-top-2.svg` — copy of paper-black-top-2 with `fill="#F92524"`

**Testimonials (app/page.tsx):**
- Added `testimonial-quote-mark.png` (red/black stylized quotation marks) above the featured quote

## Aaron — March 30, 2026

**What changed (Homepage visual QA pass):**

**Nav (components/layout/Nav.tsx):**
- Logo enlarged from 107px to 170px wide
- Added bold + underline hover state on desktop nav links (hover:font-bold + underline pseudo-element)

**Homepage (app/page.tsx):**
- Growth Through Play: heading gap increased from 64px to 108px, column gap from 80px to 90px (matching Framer spec)
- Growth Through Play: icon SVGs now render white on red circles via CSS filter (brightness(0) invert(1))
- Hero bird: replaced static image with new ParallaxBird client component (scroll-linked parallax effect at 0.3x speed)
- Torn paper dividers: hero→growth changed from red to white; growth→ecosystem changed from black to white
- How It Works: watermark repositioned to centerY 45% (was 50%); SCHOOL card CTA text changed to "Learn more about EKUZO100"
- How It Works: header block max-width widened from 600px to 800px so heading and body text fit properly
- Testimonials: heading changed from "What families are saying" to "What parents are saying" (centered, with line break); gap increased from 56px to 72px; quote max-width narrowed from 600px to 444px
- Added red TornPaperDivider before FooterBanner for clean white→red transition

**FooterBanner (components/sections/FooterBanner.tsx):**
- Removed overlapping brush stroke decoration image (replaced by torn paper divider in page.tsx)
- Top padding adjusted from 120px to 80px

**New file:**
- components/ui/ParallaxBird.tsx — client component for hero bird parallax scroll effect

**Also updated:**
- AARON-START-HERE.md — all file paths updated from ~/Desktop/Projects/EKUZO-Web to ~/Desktop/EKUZO/Projects/EKUZO-Web

## Jamie — March 27, 2026

**What changed:**
- Added `StickyCTA` component — fixed-bottom bar with "Enroll my gamer" + "Start a conversation" buttons, wired to modal system. Shows after 300px scroll, hides when modal is open. Mounted in root layout.
- Rewrote `EcosystemAnimation.tsx` — replaced broken delta-based scroll with container-relative scroll progress. Added debug overlay (currently off). Still needs PROGRESS_MAX calibration to match Framer pacing.
- Fixed `overflow-hidden` → `overflow-clip` on all 8 pages with the 360vh ecosystem section (overflow-hidden was breaking sticky positioning).
- Set up GitHub repo, transferred to EKuzo-gg org.
- Created AARON-START-HERE.md, SETUP.md, WORKLOG.md.

**What's in progress (Jamie's lane — orchestration):**
- Stripe + Beehiiv integration for camps registration (API routes not yet built)
- `.env.local` has Stripe keys but Price IDs not yet configured

**Known issues:**
- Ecosystem animation PROGRESS_MAX needs calibration (set to 200, should be ~300-400)
- Homepage needs visual QA against live Framer site
- Social icons in Footer are text placeholders, not real SVGs
